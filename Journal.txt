Thursday 12/1:     Overview: Created all classes from the UML I made on Monday 12/28

            30 MINUTE SESSION
            Built out basic Main_Project.model.Party class
            Created Main_Project.model.PartyType enum
            Messed around with LocalTime to see how best to use it for the project
            Created Main_Project.model.User class

Tuesday 12/6 (3:30 AM):     Overview: Cleaned up classes from my original UML, kept filling in basic methods in them

            30 MINUTE SESSION
            Copied over Main_Project.model.User and Main_Project.controller.UserDatabase classes from A11 and modified them for this project
            I like the way I coded those and thought it would be much easier to use them than to start from scratch
            Decided I should have an Main_Project.model.Admin subclass to Main_Project.model.User so that someone can login and alter other Main_Project.model.User classes
            Started a Main_Project.controller.PartyDatabase class as well so they can be written to files too

Tuesday 12/6 (6:30 PM):     Overview: Changed the hiearchy of the user side of things so that Hosts extend from Guests and started figuring out how to assign events to hosts when they're created

            1 HOUR SESSION
            Created new enum for RSVPs instead of doing a boolean so Guests can say "maybe"
            Built out the guest/host/admin classes and their hierarchy to make more sense

Tuesday 12/6 (8:30 PM):     Overview: Built out a lot of the main program and menus, started putting together the switches for each user type and fixed a lot of errors along the way

            3 HOUR SESSION
            Made Menu enums for each type of user that will be using the site
            Started the main program class that will run the evite system
            Fixed the Databases so they can read the correct info from files
            Started making the run() method for main
            Made the createAccount method in the Main Program class able to create different types of users
            Removed Usernames from the system since they weren't needed
            Got the createAccount method to run but now I need constructors for each type of account
            Fixed a ton of errors
            The main program now automatically makes an admin user that will be able to control the databases and evite system

Wednesday 12/7 (12:00 AM):      Overview: Made the cancelPremium() method, took a while

            1 HOUR SESSION
            Made the method to cancel the premium plan.
                Had to copy over all similar data from the premium user object to a free user object

Thursday 12/8 (10:45 PM):       Overview: Filled out the party subclasses and did a ton of error fixing to get the code to run

            1.5 HOUR SESSION
            Simplified the cancelling feature using a new cancellable interface (no need for password reset now)
            Filled out a large portion of the party subclasses
            Did a lot of error fixing
            FINALLY GOT THE CODE TO COMPILE!!!!

Saturday 12/10 (12:45 AM):      Overview: Fixed a lot of the enum menus and started working on methods within the main program that make the menus functional

            2.5 HOUR SESSION
            Added proper toString() method to party class
            Filled out the enum menus more, began work on getting each menu to function properly
            Added PartyEditMenu enum for another menu
            Added getPartyByOwner and printAllPartiesInfo methods to partyDatabase to help with menu functionality
            Added printPlan() to cancellable interface
            About 2/3 of the way done with the menu options, need to make the party editor menu still
            Update: got the program to run again with the different menus, but it is stuck on the initialMenu and won't login past it, will fix in morning
            Nevermind I just fixed this^^

Saturday 12/10 (1:00 PM):       Overview: Got most of the user menus' functions working except for the party editor and invite manager

            1 HOUR SESSION
            Added functionality for following menu options
                add friend
                remove friend
                block
                unblock
                show parties
                new party
            Created a currentParty variable so that the code can check if a user owns the party they want to edit and to make editing more simple
            Started on the invites functionality, had to make another variable for the mainProgram called currentInviteParty so that it doesnt conflict with currentUserParty

Saturday 12/10 (4:00 PM)        Overview: Made invites and party editing functional, hours of error checking to get it to run correctly

            5 HOUR SESSION
            Made invites functional
            Split partyeditmenu into two different menus for public and private parties
            Got the initialMenu to save files
            Made showPlan functional for trial and premium hosts
            Finished the party edit menus
            Program now runs
            Error fixing (too many to list but a lot of fixing adding users and parties to databases and accessing them)
            Made a demo_users file to initialize in the system to make testing easier
            Finally got the invite features to work
            Worried that initializing parties will not put them to the correct user
            Nevermind I think I finished this^
            Had to fix the way it determines class of party from the party file
            Everything seems to work now!

PROJECT FINISHED!
Things I would like to implement if given more time:
    Ability to write guest lists and invites to files
    Ability to change party to public or private
    Give admin more function
    Let the program hold payment info for premium and trial users
    Make the blocking feature more useful
