PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is a Party Planning/Evite System.

It contains a UserDatabase and a PartyDatabase that interact with each other to make the following features possible:
    Creating parties that are owned by a specific User and only editable by them
    Allowing Users to invite other Users to their events -- these invites show up when other Users log in and are answerable
    Sending party specifics to invited Users when they receive an invite
    Allow User and Party databases to initialize from txt files and assign the read-in parties to their owners

Two different class hierarchies:
    User:
        Stores email, password, name, age
        Admin:
            No special attributes but has access to deleting users and changing prices
        Guest:
            Stores User attributes and a map of parties they've been invited to with their RSVP status
            Host:
                Stores list of hosted parties, hostPoints (not fully implemented), hostRating (not fully implemented) and whether or not their account is public (not fully implemented)
                FreeHost: ability to upgrade to PremiumHost
                PremiumHost: stores friends list, blocked list and premium subscription info
                    TrialHost: stores expiration and trial info

    Party:
        Stores name, theme, party type (enum), theme, date, time, address, venue
        PublicParty: stores guest limit, ticket price and whether or not people can still rsvp (not fully implemented)
        PrivateParty: stores whether a gift is required and whether it is a surprise



It has 5 different types of User accounts built from the abstract User class:
    Admin - can add or delete users, and change the premium pricing
    Guest - can only receive and answer invites
    PremiumHost - can create and edit their own parties, receive and answer invites, have friends list and blocked lists and view their premium plan info
    FreeHost - can create and edit their own parties, and receive and answer invites
    TrialHost - same as PremiumHost but has the ability to upgrade to keep account permanent

    Premium, Free and Trial users can either cancel or upgrade their plans to the other types
        Copies their user info to new account

It has 2 different types of Party objects built from the abstract Party Class:
    PublicParty - has the options to set a guest limit, set ticket price, and change whether people can rsvp
